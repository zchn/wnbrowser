Standard fields
For now I'm going to be lazy and give you what Oren Patashnik wrote about the fields. I'll redo this sometime, including references to how each field should be formatted.

address
    Usually the address of the publisher or other type of institution. For major publishing houses, van Leunen recommends omitting the information entirely. For small publishers, on the other hand, you can help the reader by giving the complete address. 
annote
    An annotation. It is not used by the standard bibliography styles, but may be used by others that produce an annotated bibliography. 
author
    The name(s) of the author(s), in the format described in the LaTeX book. 
booktitle
    Title of a book, part of which is being cited. See the LaTeX book for how to type titles. For book entries, use the title field instead. 
chapter
    A chapter (or section or whatever) number. 
crossref
    The database key of the entry being cross referenced. Any fields that are missing from the current record are inherited from the field being cross referenced. 
edition
    The edition of a book---for example, ``Second''. This should be an ordinal, and should have the first letter capitalized, as shown here; the standard styles convert to lower case when necessary. 
editor
    Name(s) of editor(s), typed as indicated in the LaTeX book. If there is also an author field, then the editor field gives the editor of the book or collection in which the reference appears. 
howpublished
    How something strange has been published. The first word should be capitalized. 
institution
    The sponsoring institution of a technical report. 
journal
    A journal name. Abbreviations are provided for many journals. 
key
    Used for alphabetizing, cross referencing, and creating a label when the ``author'' information is missing. This field should not be confused with the key that appears in the cite command and at the beginning of the database entry. 
month
    The month in which the work was published or, for an unpublished work, in which it was written. You should use the standard three-letter abbreviation, as described in Appendix B.1.3 of the LaTeX book. 
note
    Any additional information that can help the reader. The first word should be capitalized. 
number
    The number of a journal, magazine, technical report, or of a work in a series. An issue of a journal or magazine is usually identified by its volume and number; the organization that issues a technical report usually gives it a number; and sometimes books are given numbers in a named series. 
organization
    The organization that sponsors a conference or that publishes a manual. 
pages
    One or more page numbers or range of numbers, such as 42--111 or 7,41,73--97 or 43+ (the `+' in this last example indicates pages following that don't form a simple range). To make it easier to maintain Scribe-compatible databases, the standard styles convert a single dash (as in 7-33) to the double dash used in TeX to denote number ranges (as in 7--33). 
publisher
    The publisher's name. 
school
    The name of the school where a thesis was written. 
series
    The name of a series or set of books. When citing an entire book, the the title field gives its title and an optional series field gives the name of a series or multi-volume set in which the book is published. 
title
    The work's title, typed as explained in the LaTeX book. 
type
    The type of a technical report---for example, ``Research Note''. 
volume
    The volume of a journal or multi-volume book. 
year
    The year of publication or, for an unpublished work, the year it was written. Generally it should consist of four numerals, such as 1984, although the standard styles can handle any year whose last four nonpunctuation characters are numerals, such as `\hbox{(about 1984)}'. 
URL
    The WWW Universal Resource Locator that points to the item being referenced. This often is used for technical reports to point to the ftp site where the postscript source of the report is located.
